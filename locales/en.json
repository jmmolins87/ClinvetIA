          "context": "Luna, a 3-year-old golden retriever, starts vomiting repeatedly at 2 AM. Her owner, Miguel, is worried because it won't stop and doesn't know if he should go to the ER or wait until morning.",
          "problem": "Miguel calls the clinic, but it's closed. The answering machine tells him to call during business hours. Without guidance, he decides to wait until morning. By 8 AM, Luna is dehydrated and weak. The situation worsened due to lack of early attention.",
          "solution": "Miguel contacts ClinvetIA at 2 AM. The assistant asks about symptoms, frequency, and Luna's behavior. With this information, ClinvetIA identifies signs of possible intestinal obstruction and recommends going to the ER immediately. It also automatically schedules a priority appointment and sends the information to the on-call veterinarian.",
          "impact": "Luna receives care at 3 AM, the obstruction is confirmed, and surgery is successful. Miguel greatly values the immediate response. The clinic captures an emergency case that would have otherwise gone to the competition, generating €850 in revenue and building loyalty with a high-value client."

          "problem": "Carmen calls Friday afternoon, but the clinic is already closed. She has doubts about the weekend dose. She tries to remember what they told her at the last visit 3 weeks ago, but she's not sure. She decides to keep the current dose, although she's worried it might not be correct.",
          "solution": "Carmen writes to ClinvetIA: 'Toby is calmer and drinking less, should I adjust the insulin?' ClinvetIA accesses Toby's history, reviews the latest glucose measurements, and asks about specific symptoms. It detects these are signs of mild hypoglycemia and recommends slightly reducing the dose. It sends written instructions and schedules a glucose check for Monday.",
          "impact": "Carmen safely adjusts the dose over the weekend. On Monday, Toby arrives stable for the check. The clinic avoids an ER visit for severe hypoglycemia (saving stress and €200 for Carmen) and reinforces confidence in chronic follow-up. Toby remains stable, and Carmen renews the treatment plan for 6 more months."

          "problem": "The manual process consumes 6 hours per week from the receptionist. Emails get lost in crowded inboxes. Clients don't respond or say 'I'll call later,' but never do. The clinic loses recurring revenue and patients remain unprotected.",
          "solution": "ClinvetIA sends personalized WhatsApp reminders 15 days before expiration: 'Hi Ana, Max's vaccine expires on March 20. Does Saturday the 18th at 11 AM work for you?' If the client responds 'yes,' ClinvetIA automatically schedules. If they say 'I can't that day,' it offers 3 alternatives. If no response, it sends a second reminder 7 days before.",
          "impact": "Response rate increases to 64%. The clinic schedules 210 vaccination appointments in one month (previously 61). Additional revenue: €3,150/month. Time saved: 24 hours/month. Patients are protected and owners appreciate the clinic's proactivity."

          "problem": "Laura leaves the clinic intending to call to schedule the ultrasound, but between work and family, she forgets. 6 weeks pass. No one from the clinic follows up because the system has no automatic alerts for this type of indication. When Laura finally remembers, the lump has grown.",
          "solution": "At the end of the consultation, the veterinarian records in the system: 'Ultrasound check in 2 weeks for abdominal lump.' ClinvetIA automatically sends a message to Laura 10 days later: 'Hi Laura, Dr. Gomez indicated a follow-up ultrasound for Rocky. Does Thursday the 14th at 4 PM work for you?' Laura confirms instantly.",
          "impact": "Rocky receives the ultrasound on time. A benign lipoma is detected that only requires observation. Laura feels cared for and trusts that the clinic is looking out for Rocky's health. The clinic ensures continuity of care, improves clinical outcomes, and generates an additional €90 for the ultrasound that would have otherwise been lost."

          "problem": "Marta takes her cocker 'Coco' to grooming every 6 weeks. The groomer sees that Coco has very long nails and matted fur, but doesn't have access to the medical history. No one mentions to Marta that Coco needs his annual vaccine. Marta leaves with only the grooming service (€35) and the clinic misses the opportunity to offer comprehensive care.",
          "solution": "When Marta schedules the grooming appointment via WhatsApp, ClinvetIA automatically reviews Coco's history and detects that his annual vaccine expires in 10 days. It sends: 'Hi Marta, while Coco is at grooming on Saturday, would you like to take advantage of his annual vaccine? I'll reserve 15 minutes with Dr. Lopez at the end.' Marta accepts.",
          "impact": "Coco leaves groomed and vaccinated in a single visit. Marta saves an extra trip and values the convenience. The clinic bills €35 (grooming) + €45 (vaccine) = €80 instead of €35. It also reinforces cross-selling between services and improves the client experience."

          "problem": "Sofia calls Wednesday at 6 PM, but the receptionist tells her that Dr. Martinez is busy and 'we'll call you.' Two days pass. Sofia calls again Friday. They tell her everything is fine, but give no details. Sofia feels ignored and frustrated. The post-sale experience is poor, even though the clinical service was excellent.",
          "solution": "When Bella's results arrive in the system on Wednesday, ClinvetIA automatically sends a message to Sofia: 'Hi Sofia, Bella's test results are ready. Everything is within normal values. Dr. Martinez will review the details with you tomorrow Thursday at 10 AM by video call or phone, which do you prefer?' Sofia chooses phone and receives the full explanation the next day.",
          "impact": "Sofia feels informed and calm. Dr. Martinez can review the results calmly, without interruptions. The clinic improves the client experience, reduces repetitive calls to reception (saves 20 min), and reinforces the perception of professionalism and personalized care."
